# BOM #3: Provider Info

The Provider Info object describes the menu of API facilities a Provider application can provide to the Consumer application.

Also, most importantly, an indication of the balance for the account being presented to the Consumer.

## Wad Object

An object to represent a quantity of value denominated in millisatoshis (msats).

Also optionally, specifies the non-BTC asset that is the primary, user-understood asset of this quantity of value. If specified, it is understood that the `msat` value will be regularly updated to maintain stability of asset value.

### Exchange rate

The `msat` value and `units` in the `non_btc` objects imply an exchange rate between these assets which can be mathematically derived. It is not redundantly specified in the object, but this value is typically important for calculations involving this object.

### Examples

```
{ 'msat': 12350,
  'non_btc': null}
```
Suggested end-user display: `â‚¿ 12.350 sat`
